        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
          LeanX is a final year engineering project designed to help users track workouts,
          analyze progress, and stay consistent with their fitness goals. The platform
          focuses on clarity, simplicity, and efficiency, delivering only what users
          actually need.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Project Background</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
          LeanX was developed by a two-member final year engineering team as part of an
          academic project. The idea originated from identifying gaps in existing fitness
          applications, particularly around usability, long-term maintainability, and
          meaningful progress visualization.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2">
          The project was built with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, scalable
          design, and modern development practices.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Technology & Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
          LeanX represents the practical application of concepts learned during our
          engineering program, including full-stack development, database management,
          authentication, and responsive UI/UX design.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2">
          Through this project, we strengthened our skills in teamwork, version control,
          problem-solving, and building production-ready applications.

        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
          LeanX aims to demonstrate how a focused and minimal approach can lead to a more
          effective fitness platform. The goal is to create a system that is easy to use,
          easy to maintain, and adaptable for future enhancements.
